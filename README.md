#Above ground carbon estimation in thicket using multi-spectral images
This project develops a method for remote sensing of above ground carbon (AGC) in subtropical thicket.  The work was undertaken as part of the part of the GEF5-SLM (sustainable land management project) project. 

AGC ground truth data was generated by applying existing allometric models to woody and litter measurements in 90 plots situated in a small area in the Baviaanskloof, South Africa. Univariate and multivariate models were subsequently built to predict AGC from features in a 2017 [WorldView-3](http://worldview3.digitalglobe.com/) (0.34m resolution 8-band) multi-spectral image.  A stepwise forward selection approach was used to select informative image features a set of spectral, textural and vegetation index measures.  In addition to the snapshot AGC models, a simple temporal calibration method was devised to facilitate the generation of repeat AGC maps of the study area.  This was tested multi-temporal images (consisting of two additional WorldView-3 images and one 0.5 m resolution 4-band aerial image mosaic).
