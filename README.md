#Above ground carbon estimation in thicket using multi-spectral images

Aboveground carbon (AGC) maps are needed for planning and monitoring of thicket restoration in South Africa.  Field methods for measuring biomass are labour-intensive and and only practical for small areas.  To work around these challenges, we developed a method for mapping AGC in thicket using satellite imagery, that can scale to large areas.  The work was undertaken as part of the part of the [GEF5-SLM](https://www.thegef.org/project/securing-multiple-ecosystems-benefit-through-slm-productive-degraded-landscapes-south-africa) (sustainable land management project) project.  You may find the generic modules for allometric calculations, image feature extraction, feature selection and mapping useful for other projects.

## Description
A regression modelling approach was followed for predicting AGC from features in multi-spectral imagery.  Ground truth AGC data for model fitting were generated by applying [existing allometric models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335531470_Aboveground_biomass_and_carbon_pool_estimates_of_Portulacaria_afra_spekboom-rich_subtropical_thicket_with_species-specific_allometric_models) to plant measurements gathered in the Baviaanskloof, South Africa.  Plants were measured in 90 plots spread over three degradation strata (image in colour-infrared rendering).

Spectral, textural, vegetation index features are extracted from a 2017 [WorldView-3](http://worldview3.digitalglobe.com/) (0.34m resolution 8-band) multi-spectral image.  The code fits modelsto a subset of informative features using straightforward linear regression.  AGC maps of the study area were produced by applying fitted models to the WorldView-3 image in a memory and processor-efficient routine.

Extending models spatially and temporally is currently a major challenge in remote sensing.  In addition to the snapshot AGC models, a simple temporal calibration method was devised to experiment with repeat mapping of the study area.  This was tested on an additional two WorldView-3 images, and an aerial image mosaic, with encouraging results.
