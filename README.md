# Above ground carbon estimation in thicket using multi-spectral images
Aboveground carbon (AGC) maps are needed for planning and monitoring of thicket restoration in South Africa.  Field methods for measuring biomass are labour-intensive and and only practical for small areas.  To work around these challenges, we developed a method for mapping AGC using satellite imagery.  The work was undertaken as part of the part of the [GEF5-SLM](https://www.thegef.org/project/securing-multiple-ecosystems-benefit-through-slm-productive-degraded-landscapes-south-africa) (sustainable land management project) project.  You may find the modules for allometric calculations, image feature extraction, feature selection and mapping useful for other projects.

## Installation
I recommend using conda with the conda-forge channel to resolve binary dependencies:
- Clone the git repository    
        
        git clone git+https://github.com/dugalh/map_thicket_agc.git
- Create a conda environment and install dependencies:

        conda create -n <environment name> python=3.8 -c conda-forge 
        conda activate <environment name> 
        conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib numpy scipy scikit-learn openpyxl rasterio geopandas 
- Setup `<environment name>` to use the local repository        
        
        pip install -e <path to repository>

The above two commands can be done in one step with (but the two commands separately are probably clearer):

    `pip install --user -e git+https://dugalh%40gmail.com:Muizenber9@github.com/dugalh/map_thicket_agc.git#egg=map-thicket-agc`

`pip install git+https://dugalh%40gmail.com:[password]@github.com/dugalh/map_thicket_agc.git`

## Description
We used multivariate regression modelling for predicting AGC from features in multi-spectral imagery.  Ground truth AGC data for model fitting were generated by applying [existing allometric models](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335531470_Aboveground_biomass_and_carbon_pool_estimates_of_Portulacaria_afra_spekboom-rich_subtropical_thicket_with_species-specific_allometric_models) to plant measurements gathered in the Baviaanskloof, South Africa.  90 sampling plots were spread over three degradation strata (WorldView-3 image in colour-infrared rendering).

The code evaluates spectral, textural and vegetation index features extracted from a 2017 [WorldView-3](http://worldview3.digitalglobe.com/) (0.34m resolution 8-band) multi-spectral image (shown above).  This plot shows the results of a linear model fitted to a subset of informative features, selected using stepwise forward selection.  Some testing was done with more sophisticated models, but they did not improve on these results.  



The code includes classes for generating maps by applying generic models to images in a memory and processor efficient way.  An example map for the linear AGC model is shown below.

Extending models spatially and temporally is currently a major challenge in remote sensing.  In addition to the snapshot AGC models, a simple temporal calibration method was devised to experiment with repeat mapping of the study area over time.  We tested this method on an additional two WorldView-3 images, and an aerial image mosaic, with encouraging results. (The table shows *R*<sup>2</sup> for models fitted with a WorldView-3 Oct 2017 image and calibrated to the additional images. AGC is assumed constant over the image capture dates).
